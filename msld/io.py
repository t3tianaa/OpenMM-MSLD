"""Trajectory / results output for lambda-dynamics runs.

`LambdaDynamics` samples atoms + theta; this module writes the run's *observables* — per-block
lambda + potential energy (+ theta temperature) — to disk as the run proceeds. It is the minimal
first piece of the deferred io layer: the lambda/energy trajectory + a populations summary. Free
energy (DeltaG) estimation is NOT here yet (needs ALF flattening + analysis; see vault FEAT-040 / FEAT-012).

Each writer carries its own step `every` interval and manages its own file, so a run just names
the outputs and the intervals -- no `with` needed (`LambdaDynamics.run` opens nothing and closes
every reporter for you):

    dyn.run(10_000,
            metrics="out/metrics.csv",    metrics_every=100,   mapping=bundle.mapping,
            trajectory="out/traj.dcd",    trajectory_every=500, structure=bundle.structure)
    print(populations("out/metrics.csv"))     # mean lambda per block == raw variant populations

The reporters (`LambdaTrajectoryWriter`, `TrajectoryWriter`) are also usable directly via
`dyn.run(nsteps, reporters=[...])` if you want to build them yourself; each has `.every`,
`.report(dyn, step)`, and `.close()`.

    `structure` is the hybrid ParmEd Structure (used only for its OpenMM `topology` + initial
    positions). On the first frame it writes a companion topology PDB (`<stem>.pdb`) so the DCD is
    loadable in a viewer, then appends `dyn.x` each interval. The DCD is opened lazily on the first
    report (so the per-frame time = timestep * every is known) and closed by `LambdaDynamics.run`.

    The companion PDB keeps the DCD's atom order (so it indexes the frames), which means it is the
    RAW topology, not the merged-HYB rendering of `hybrid_output.write_hybrid_pdb` (that one reorders
    atoms). The raw topology appends each competing variant's side chain as its OWN residue named
    after the standard amino acid but holding only the side-chain fragment (no backbone). Left as-is,
    `PDBFile.writeFile` treats those as standard residues and writes NO CONECT, so a viewer misapplies
    the amino-acid template and cannot bond the fragment to the shared CB -> the side chains render as
    free-floating atoms. Passing `mapping` fixes this: the block-only residues are renamed to
    `hyb_resname` (a non-standard name) just for the PDB, which makes `writeFile` emit CONECT for
    their bonds and stops the template misapplication. Atom order is unchanged.
